## Quantitative Actuary in Development | FEA-USP & FEA.dev
My journey isn't about choosing between classic actuarial rigor and the speed of data science. It's about being the professional who masters both.

## Objectives:
I am building a profile to operate at the intersection of mathematics, programming, and market strategy. I am actively seeking to connect with leaders and teams in **Quantitative Trading**, **Asset Management**, and **Market Risk** to solve high-impact challenges.
